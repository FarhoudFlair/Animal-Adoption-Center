Purpose:

    This application serves to provide a platform where clients are able to be matched with an animal from an adoption center.
    Staff members are able to add and edit animal information, as well as run the matching algorithm to match animals with clients.

Compilation command:

    Run the shell script "build_linux.sh", i.e. `./build_linux.sh`

    NOTE: rebuilding the application will reset the database, thus wiping all user data.

Launching command:

    Run the shell script "run_linux.sh", i.e. `./run_linux.sh`

Program Instruction:

    For deliverable #4, we have implemented functionality for:
        Launching and executing the ACM algorithm (staff feature)

    As a staff member, to launch the ACM algorithm, go to the algorithm page by clicking the "View Algorithm Page" button after logging in, then clicking the "Launch Matching Algorithm" button. To view the details of a particular match, simply double click its entry on the list of matches.

    Once the application is launched, the user will be able to log in as client or staff. If choosing to login as a client, the user must click 'Login as Client', double click one of the 80 clients they wish to log in as on the next page.

    As a client or staff member, the user is able to view the full list of 100 animals.

    As a client, the user is able to edit their own profile by clicking on the "View Your Profile" button, editing their profile information, and clicking the "Save" button.

    As a staff member, the user is able to view a list of clients by clicking the "View Clients" button. To view the details of a particular client, simply double click the client within the list of clients.

    As a staff member, the user is able to view the list of animals, add new animals, and edit animals by clicking the "View Animals" button. To edit a particular animal, simply double click it.

    As either a client or a staff member, to view the details of a particular animal, double click an animal on the list of animals.
