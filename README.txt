Purpose:

    This application serves to provide a platform where clients are able to be matched with an animal from an adoption centre.
    Staff members are able to add and edit animal information, as well as run the matching algorithm to match animals with clients.

Compilation command:

    Run the shell script "build_linux.sh", i.e. `./build_linux.sh`

    Note that rebuilding the application will reset the database thus wiping all user data.

Launching command:

    Run the shell script "run_linux.sh", i.e. `./run_linux.sh`

Program Instruction:

    For deliverable #3, we have implemented functionality for:
        Edit client (client)
        Edit animal (staff)

    Once application is launched, the user will be able to log in as client or staff. The user must select a client, then click "Login as Client" to login as that client.

    As a client, the user is able to view the list of 50 animals.

    As a client, the user is able to edit their own profile by clicking on the "Your Profile" tab, editing their profile information, and clicking the save button.

    As a staff member, the user is able to view the list of animals, add new animals, and edit animals in the "Animals" tab. To edit a particular animal, simply double click it.

    As a staff member, to view the details of a particular client, simply double click the client within the list of clients.

    As either a client or a staff member, to view the details of a particular animal, double click an animal on the list of animals.
