Purpose:

    This application serves to provide a platform where clients are able to be matched with an animal from an adoption centre.
    Staff members are able to add and edit animal information, as well as run the matching algorithm to match animals with clients.

Compilation command:

    Run the shell script "build_linux.sh", i.e. `./build_linux.sh`.

Launching command:

    Run the shell script "run_linux.sh", i.e. `./run_linux.sh`.

Program Instruction:

    For deliverable #2, we have implemented functionality for:
        View all animals (as staff or client)
        Add animal
        View all clients
        Add client

    Once application is launched, the user will be able to log in as client or staff. The user must select a client, then click "Login as Client" to login as that client.

    As a client, the user is able to view the list of 50 animals.

    As a staff member, the user is able to both view the list of animals and add new animals.

    As a client, to view the details of a particular client, simply double click the client within the list of clients.

    As either a client or a staff member, to view the details of a particular animal, double click an animal on the list of animals.
